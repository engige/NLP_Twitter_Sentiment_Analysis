# Tweet Text Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for analyzing sentiment in Tweets related to Apple and Google products. The dataset comprises over 9,000 Tweets labeled as positive, negative, or neutral by human raters. The objective is to create a robust generalized sentiment classification model that can accurately predict sentiment based on the content of the Tweets, providing Apple and Google with actionable insights for their marketing and product development teams. The goal is to help these stakeholders understand consumer perception, identify trends, and enhance customer engagement.

### Objectives:
1. **Develop a Sentiment Classification Model**:
   - Build an NLP model capable of accurately classifying Tweets as positive, negative, or neutral to help Apple and Google assess public opinion about their products.
2. **Evaluate Model Performance for Binary and Multiclass Classification**:
   - Optimize binary classification (positive vs. negative) and multiclass classification (positive, negative, neutral) to ensure high accuracy and balance across all classes, with a focus on improving the detection of negative sentiment.
3. **Provide Business Insights to Stakeholders**:
   - Use model results to provide insights on how Apple and Google can respond to public opinion, identify marketing opportunities, and enhance product development** strategies.

The models developed can be deployed to provide actionable insights for stakeholders at Apple and Google, ensuring they can monitor public sentiment effectively and make informed decisions for marketing and product development.

## Business Understanding

* **Stakeholder:** The primary stakeholders are the marketing and product development teams at Apple and Google. These teams seek to understand public sentiment towards their products to guide marketing strategies, product enhancements, and customer engagement initiatives.

* **Business Problem:** Apple and Google aim to monitor and analyze general consumer sentiment on social media platforms to gauge public perception and identify trends in how their products are received. A generalized sentiment analysis model based on Tweet content will help them quickly assess whether social media conversations about their products are positive, negative, or neutral. This will allow them to respond to broad public opinion more effectively, identify potential marketing opportunities, and enhance customer engagement.

## Data Understanding

* **Dataset:** The project utilizes a dataset from CrowdFlower via data.world, containing over 9,000 Tweets about Apple and Google products. Each Tweet annotated by human raters with a sentiment classification: positive, negative, or neutral.

* **Suitability:** This dataset is well-suited for the business problem as it provides a sizable and diverse collection of real-time consumer opinions. The multi-class sentiment labels facilitate both binary (positive/negative) and multi-class classification tasks, allowing for scalable model development.
